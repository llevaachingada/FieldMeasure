# Build Log

**The agent's memory across sessions.** Read the last entry to find your place; append one entry per
slice, in the same commit as the slice.

**Status: no slices started.** Next action: **slice 0.0** in `docs/implementation-plan.md`.

## Entry template — copy this

```
## Slice <n> — <name>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD · **Commit:** <sha>

**Built:** <one or two lines: what now exists that did not before>

**Machine gates:** <n>/<n> passing
- [x] <gate text>
- [x] <gate text>

**Deferred to hardware:** <n> gates → logged in docs/HARDWARE-TEST-CHECKLIST.md under slice <n>

**Checkpoints fired:** <C<n> — measured X, took row Y> | none

**Decisions recorded:** <DECISIONS entries added> | none

**Surprises:** <anything that disagreed with the docs, and what you did — including any spec

```

## BLOCKED entries

If the three-strike rule (`docs/BUILD-RUNBOOK.md` §6) fires, append here instead and stop:

```
## BLOCKED — slice <n>
**What fails:** <exact failure, with the command and the output>
**Attempt 1:** <what you tried, why it failed>
**Attempt 2:** <…>
**Attempt 3:** <…>
**My read:** <what you believe is wrong, in the spec or the plan>
**Needs:** <what would unblock it>
```
